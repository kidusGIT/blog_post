This project is built using React and Node js. 

- The client directory contain the front-end part of the project.
    - I use bootstrap and normal or "vanilla" css for styling the web page. 
    - I use context api as state management.
    - I use locale storage to store the token from the server.
    - I use the front-end to display what the server responds.
    - You can start the react server by going to your terminal and cd to the client then type "npm start" command 
    
- The server directory contain the back-end part of the project.
    - I use sqlite as a database, if you don not have sqlite database on your machine you can download it [using this link ](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/). 
    - I use sequelize library for manipulating the database.
    - I use sqlite database because it is light, fast and suitable for development. We can use other database for production purpose, for development it is better to use sqlite.
    - To switch to other database go to server/database.js and uncomment the code for connecting to MySQL database.
    - You can start the node server by going to your terminal and cd to server then type "npm run server" command
